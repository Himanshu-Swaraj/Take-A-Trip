                    <p>
                        The best way to travel within India is to travel by road 
                        as this offers you an opportunity to have a glimpse of 
                        real INDIA as you can visit en-route villages and small 
                        forts at your own pace which is not possible by air or 
                        by train. But, if you are travelling to long distance, 
                        then taking a flight or trains can be more convenient 
                        and to save time.
